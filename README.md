# Network Management (COM615) 2025

Material for Level 6 Network Management Module

## Introduction

Welcome to the tutorial material for Solent UNI Network Management (COM615) 2025

This module will introduce you to the fascinating and complex world of Network and systems Management.

The material on this site should be sufficient for you to study on your own and in class. 
Many of the exercises can be done on a PC with Docker Desktop installed and sufficient memory available.

You can see the contents menu for the module under [sessions](../main/sessions) 


## Using this Github material

With the wide adoption of Software Defined Networking and network configuration tools such as Ansible, learning to use version control systems such as GIT are an important skill for anyone involved in systems administration or network management. 

This repository is set up to allow your tutor to continuously update material which you can use explore various exercises.

The intention is that you `fork` this repository into your own github account where you can copy and make changes to the examples as you progress.

Details on using Git and merging upstream work are provided in [Setting Up and using Git](../main/usingGit).

To make merging easier, this repository is organised in three separate sections.

* Sessions
* myPracticeCourseWork,
* workup

[Sessions](../main/sessions) Contains the tutorial material for each session.

This is where the tutorials and examples for each week will be created and updated each week.
PLEASE do not change material here as it will be updated each week and you will have difficulty merging any upstream changes with your own work.
Instead COPY each session's material into your own [myPracticeCourseWork](../main/myPracticeCourseWork) folder and use and modify it from there.

[myPracticeCourseWork](../main/myPracticeCourseWork) Is your private working folder.

This is where you should create and save your own practice projects.
Your tutor will NEVER overlay new material here so you can commit any of your own work into this folder.
When you `commit` your changes and `push` them to Github, your work in [myPracticeCourseWork](../main/myPracticeCourseWork) will be a permanent record of what you have been working on.

[workup](../main/workup) is your Tutors work in progress folder.

This is where your tutor creates and updates material before publication each week. 
You are welcome to look at stuff here but mostly it is not complete and won't work (yet).
Don't make your own changes here.


See [Setting Up and using Git](../main/usingGit) for more instructions on getting started with git and forking this repository.
